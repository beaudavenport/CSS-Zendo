CSS-Zendo
=========

(Harvard Edx CS50 final project repository) CSS Zendo is a web-based educational game application. A user enters CSS commands in a simulated stylesheet, which dynamically changes elements on the game "board".  The game has multiple levels with different objectives that can only be completed by changing the CSS attributes of the game elements.
